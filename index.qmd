## Session Overview

This intensive 4-hour session is designed for mathematics PG students and faculty to rigorously explore the discipline of Data Science through the lens of Applied Mathematics and modern computation.

We will move beyond a high-level overview to establish a strong theoretical and practical foundation, demonstrating how core mathematical principles—from Linear Algebra and Optimization to Probability and Statistics—form the engine of today's most powerful AI systems.

## Target Audience

Postgraduate Students in Mathematics, Statistics, and related fields.

Faculty members seeking to integrate modern Data Science curriculum into their teaching and research.

## Session Mode

The session is structured in an interactive mode, blending in-depth mathematical derivations with live computational demonstrations using industry-standard tools (e.g., Python/R environments).

We will emphasize:

- Mathematical Derivations: Understanding the why behind algorithms.

- Computational Execution: Translating theory into working code.

- Critical Analysis: Evaluating model performance based on mathematical metrics.
