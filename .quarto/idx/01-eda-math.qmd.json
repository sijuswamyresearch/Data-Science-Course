It is the first and most essential step\nin any analytical or machine learning workflow.\n\nIn simple terms, **EDA tells us the story hidden inside the data**.\n\n\n\n### Why is EDA Important?\n\nEDA is crucial because:\n\n- It helps understand the structure and characteristics of a dataset before formal modelling.\n- It reveals hidden relationships among variables.\n- It identifies noise, outliers, missing values, and inconsistencies.\n- It guides the selection of appropriate statistical or machine learning models.\n- It prevents incorrect assumptions that could lead to misleading conclusions.\n\nWithout EDA, modelling becomes guesswork rather than a scientifically grounded analysis.\n\n\n\n### Common Statistical Tools Used in EDA\n\n| Statistical Method | Purpose |\n|--------------------|---------|\n| Mean, Median, Mode | Central behaviour of data |\n| Variance, Standard Deviation | Spread or variability |\n| Quantiles & IQR | Range and distribution behaviour |\n| Correlation measures | Strength and direction of relationships |\n| Covariance matrices | Linear dependence structure |\n| Normality tests | Distributional assumptions |\n\n\n\n### Common Visualization Tools in EDA\n\n| Plot Type | Purpose |\n|-----------|---------|\n| Histogram | Distribution and skewness |\n| Boxplot | Outliers and spread |\n| Scatter Plot | Relationship between paired variables |\n| Pairplot (matrix plot) | All relationships in multivariate dataset |\n| Heatmap | Correlation structure |\n| Violin Plot / KDE plot | Shape of distribution |\n\nData visualization converts numeric tables into human-understandable patterns and evidence.\n\n\n\n### How EDA Helps at Different Levels\n\n| Stakeholder | Benefit |\n|-------------|---------|\n| **Common Individual** | Gains clarity about dataset behaviour without technical depth |\n| **Data Scientist / Analyst** | Learns structure, prepares features, selects models, validates assumptions |\n| **Professional Decision Maker / Policy Planner** | Makes informed strategic decisions based on evidence instead of intuition |\n\nReal-world example:\n\n- In healthcare analytics, EDA may reveal that a specific symptom correlates strongly with disease severity.\n- Decision makers can deploy targeted interventions or allocate resources precisely.\n\nThus, **EDA transforms raw data into insight, and insight into action**.\n\n## The Iris Dataset — Historical and Scientific Importance\n\nBefore conducting the exploratory analysis, it is important to introduce the dataset that\nwill be used throughout this module: the **Iris Flower Dataset**, one of the most well-known\nbenchmarks in statistics, machine learning, and pattern recognition.\n\nThe dataset was first introduced by **Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher (1890–1962)** in his\ngroundbreaking 1936 paper titled *\"The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems\"*.\nSir R. A. Fisher, widely regarded as the **Father of Modern Statistics**, pioneered foundational\nconcepts such as maximum likelihood estimation, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and statistical\nexperimental design. His Iris study demonstrated how quantitative measurements could be used\nto classify biological specimens through multivariate statistics—an idea that evolved into\nmodern machine learning classification techniques.\n\n\n### Description of the Dataset\n\nThe Iris dataset consists of **150 samples** of iris flowers collected from three species:\n\n| Species | Count |\n|---------|--------|\n| *Iris setosa* | 50 |\n| *Iris versicolor* | 50 |\n| *Iris virginica* | 50 |\n\nFor each sample, **four morphological measurements** were recorded (in centimetres):\n\n| Feature | Description |\n|----------|--------------|\n| **Sepal Length** | length of the outer part of the flower |\n| **Sepal Width** | width of the outer part |\n| **Petal Length** | length of the inner petal |\n| **Petal Width** | width of the inner petal |\n\nThus, the dataset can be represented mathematically as:\n$$\nX = \\{x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_{150}\\} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^4\n$$\nwhere each vector\n$$\nx_i = (\\text{sepal length},\\ \\text{sepal width},\\ \\text{petal length},\\ \\text{petal width})\n$$\n\nThe corresponding class label\n$$\ny_i \\in \\{\\text{setosa}, \\text{versicolor}, \\text{virginica}\\}\n$$\n\n\n\n### Why is the Iris Dataset Important?\n\n- Serves as an ideal educational dataset for demonstrating statistical and machine learning concepts.\n- Exhibits distinct geometric separation between classes, inspiring early classification algorithms.\n- Provides simple structure yet complex enough for real-world pattern recognition.\n- Forms the basis for classical methods such as **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)** introduced by Fisher himself.\n\n\n### Iris Dataset and EDA\n\nThe Iris dataset is particularly suited for **Exploratory Data Analysis** because:\n\n- It contains both numeric features and categorical labels.\n- It enables visual analysis of relationships between pairs of variables.\n- It reveals distributional differences across species.\n- It supports understanding of dimensionality reduction and classification.\n\nWith this context, we now proceed to **perform a detailed EDA** of the dataset.\n\n\n\n## Exploratory Data Analysis with the Iris Dataset\n\nA glimps of the datset is shown below:\n\n```{python}\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Load iris dataset\ndf = sns.load_dataset(\"iris\")\n\n# Display first rows\ndf.head()\n```\n\nA summary of the dataset is shown below:\n\n```{python}\ndf.describe()\n```\n\n>Pairwise Relationships\n```{python}\nsns.pairplot(df, hue='species')\nplt.show()\n```\n\n> Feature Distributions\n\n```{python}\ndf.hist(figsize=(8,6), bins=10)\nplt.suptitle(\"Distribution of Features in Iris Dataset\")\nplt.show()\n```\n>Correlation Heatmap\n\n```{python}\nsns.heatmap(df.corr(numeric_only=True), annot=True)\nplt.title(\"Correlation Matrix\")\nplt.show()\n```\n\n## Reflections\n\n- How do norms relate to similarity and distance in machine learning algorithms?\n\n- How does EDA support model selection and problem formulation?\n\n- Which relationships among the Iris features appear strongest from the heatmap?\n\n## References","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%;
